# The Flutter Recipes

My first dart/flutter project.

I've created a Node.js API that connects to a MySQL db containing: recipes, ingredients and steps. (hejmi/recipe-cave-crud)

This project started as a school learning project in React Js (hejmi/recipe-cave), then I also tried it in Angular Ts (hejmi/angular-recipes) and now with Dart/Flutter.
